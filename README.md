# Malware Analysis Report of unknown.exe.malz (SickoMode)

 

Creating detailed reports is a crucial aspect of malware analysis, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the findings and helps inform decision-making at higher levels, such as the CISO. I want to be different and instead of just answering questions, I wanted to do more of an analysis report, this is something you will have to do and to me is the most important part. Yes

# Basic Dynamic Analysis

On initional detonation, with no network simulation the malwaare deletes itself soon after execution.

On the second detonation, now with network simulation and the presence of wireshark we can see the 1st callback domain. the binary delets itself again. the binary is reaching out to "hxxp://update.ec12-4-109-278-3-ubuntu20-04[.]local"

On the third detonation with Wireshark still running we a continuous stream of GET request with a changing value being posted. Once I stop inetsim(which is what I an using for network simulation), the binary then deletes itself from the host machine.
